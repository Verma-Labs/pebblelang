# PebbleLang

PebbleLang is a human-readable programming language built from scratch using Python by Atul Verma, a Hobbyist.  
It supports variable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditional execution, and simple loops â€” all written in plain English.

This is not a full language, but a working interpreter designed to explore how languages are built from first principles.

```plaintext
set x to 5                   # assign value
increase x by 2             # add number or variable
decrease y by 1             # subtract
show x                      # print value

if x is greater than y then
  show x
end
